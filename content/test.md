It's nice with a few more links in the nav bar. This makes it look like it
servers a purpose.

markdown tables
---

A nice markdown feature is the tables. It is something I'd like to test here.

    | one                 | way             | to    | do    | tables        |
    |:--------------------|----------------:|------:|-------|:--------------|
    | wrong               | way             | to    |       | write data    |
    | this                | which           |
    | is a                | would make this |
    | more correct way to | column right-   |
    | post data           | aligned         |

this markdown code produces this table:

| one                 | way             | to    | do    | tables        |
|:--------------------|----------------:|------:|-------|:--------------|
| wrong               | way             | to    |       | write data    |
| this                | which           |
| is a                | would make this |
| more correct way to | column right-   |
| post data           | aligned         |

I believe there are more ways to write tables in markdown, but will not try them
here.

The tables here should get some CSS love, but we'll see. If there's time for it.
